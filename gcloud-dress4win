# Sample Case Study: Dress4win

several hundred servers and appliances
in a colocated data center. However, the capacity of their
infrastructure is now insu£cient for the application’s rapid
growth

# Solution Concept
For the first phase of their migration to the cloud, Dress4win
is considering moving their development and test
environments. They are also considering building a disaster
recovery site, because their current infrastructure is at a
single location. They are not sure which components of their
architecture they can migrate as is and which components
they need to change before migrating them.

The Dress4win application is served out of a single data
center location
# Databases:
MySQL - user data, inventory, static data
Redis - metadata, social graph, caching
## Cloud SQL 

# Application servers:
Tomcat - Java micro-services    ## App Engine
Nginx - static content          ## Storage
Apache Beam - Batch processing  ## Data Flow
# Storage appliances:
iSCSI for VM hosts
Fiber channel SAN - MySQL databases
NAS - image storage, logs, backups
# Apache Hadoop/Spark servers:
Data analysis
Real-time trending calculations
# MQ servers:
Messaging
Social notifications
Events
# Miscellaneous servers:
Deployment manager Jenkins, Stackdriver monitoring, Compute engine and private network hosts bastion hosts, Cloud Security scanners - App engine scanners. security scanners

# Business Requirements
Build a reliable and reproducible environment with
scaled parity of production.    # Deployment manager

Improve security by defining and adhering to a set of
security and Identity and Access Management (IAM)
best practices for cloud.

Improve business agility and speed of innovation
through rapid provisioning of new resources.

Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in
the cloud.

Migrate fully to the cloud if all other requirements are
met.

# Technical Requirements
Evaluate and choose an automation framework for
provisioning resources in cloud.

Support failover of the production environment to
cloud during an emergency.

Identify production services that can migrate to cloud
to save capacity.

Use managed services whenever possible.

Encrypt data on the wire and at rest.

Support multiple VPN connections between the
production data center and cloud environment.

# CEO Statement
Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and
contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also
concerned that a new competitor could use a public cloud
platform to offset their up-front investment and freeing them
to focus on developing better features.

# CTO Statement
We have invested heavily in the current infrastructure, but
much of the equipment is approaching the end of its useful
life. We are consistently waiting weeks for new gear to be
racked before we can start new projects. Our traffic patterns
are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during
other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.

# CFO Statement
Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly
projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial
increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before
our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership
(TCO) analysis over the next 5 years puts a cloud strategy
between 30 to 50% lower than our current model

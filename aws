####  Elastic Load Balancing

A Layer 4 load balancer works at the network protocol level and does not look inside of the actual network packets, remaining unaware of the specifics of HTTP and HTTPS

A Layer 7 load balancer is more sophisticated and more powerful. It inspects packets, has access to HTTP and HTTPS headers, and (armed with more information) can do a more intelligent job of spreading the load out to the target.

####  Types of AWS load balancers
- ELB 		# classic
- ALB		# Application load balancing
	- Content based routing	# define up to 10 URL-based rules to route requests to target groups
	- Container based applications 	# It allows one instance to host several containers that listen on multiple ports behind the same target group and also performs fine-grained, port-level health checks

- NLB		# Network Load Balancer - handles a much larger traffic volume than a standard ELB, and can distribute traffic across geographically distinct subnets within AWS

####  Data Storage Types
- instance store volume		# volume disappears when instance goes away
- Elastic Block Storage (EBS)	# like physical NAS drive EBS tied to a single instance at a time
- Elastic File System (EFS)	# like NFS, distributed

- simple storage service(S3)	# NAS not tied to instance
- Glacier			# Cold storage

####  Database Services
- MySQL				# PostgresSQL, Oracle, MSSQL (depreciated)
- RDS Aurora			# MySQL compatible - HA and perform scaling
- DynamoDB			# NoSQL database

#### Accounts
- VPC Accounts		# each define one or more virtual private clouds (VPCs). Each VPC has its own private network and corresponding IP range, so a VPC account can support multiple independent network environments.

- Classic		# each define a single private network and corresponding IP range

##### Security
- Security groups 	# A security group defines a set of rules that control access to each resource belonging to the group, creating a firewall around group members. An instance or other resource can belong to more than one security groupâ€”the access to that resource is set by the aggregate of the multiple security group rules.


####  Monitoring
- CloudWatch 		# monitors AWS resources and provides metrics about their use that includes costs. It can also control instance auto scaling
- CloudTrail		# logs management API calls and console actions to provide a history of AWS resource management

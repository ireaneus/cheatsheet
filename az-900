## Economies of scale - lower power, cooling, network costs

# Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
Migrating workloads
Test and development
Website hosting
Storage, backup, and recovery

# Platform as a service (PaaS)
Development framework
Analytics or business intelligence

# Software as a service (SaaS)

IaaS requires the most user management of all the cloud services. The user is responsible for managing the operating systems, data, and applications.
PaaS requires less user management. The cloud provider manages the operating systems, and the user is responsible for the applications and data they run and store.
SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the software.

## Azure account services
An Azure free subscription includes a $200 credit to spend on any service for the first 30 days, free access to the most popular Azure products for 12 months, and access to more than 25 products that are always free. This is an excellent way for new users to get started. To set up a free subscription, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft account.

A Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) subscription charges you monthly for the services you used in that billing period.

An Enterprise Agreement provides flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement

An Azure for Students subscription includes $100 in Azure credits to be used within the first 12 months plus select free services without requiring a credit card at sign-up

You can create multiple subscriptions under a single Azure account. This is particularly useful for businesses because access control and billing occur at the subscription level, not the account level.

One bill is generated for every Azure subscription on a monthly basis


# Authentication with Azure Active Directory
Azure AD is a modern identity provider that supports multiple authentication protocols to secure applications and services in the cloud.
Azure AD is all about web-based authentication standards such as OpenID and OAuth.

# App Service costs
You pay for the Azure compute resources your app uses while it processes requests based on the App Service Plan you choose. The App Service plan determines how much hardware is devoted to your host - for example, whether it's dedicated or shared hardware, and how much memory is reserved for it. There is even a free tier you can use to host small, low-traffic sites.

Web Apps
App Service includes full support for hosting web apps using ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. You can choose either Windows or Linux as the host operating system.

API Apps
Much like hosting a website, you can build REST-based Web APIs using your choice of language and framework. You get full Swagger support, and the ability to package and publish your API in the Azure Marketplace

Web Jobs
WebJobs allows you to run a program (.exe, Java, PHP, Python or Node.js) or script (.cmd, .bat, PowerShell, or Bash) in the same context as a web app, API app, or mobile app

Mobile Apps
Use the Mobile Apps feature of Azure App Service to quickly build a back-end for iOS and Android apps. With just a few clicks in the Azure portal you can:

	Store mobile app data in a cloud-based SQL database
	Authenticate customers against common social providers such as MSA, Google, Twitter and Facebook
	Send push notifications
	Execute custom back-end logic in C# or Node.js

On the mobile app side, there is SDK support for native iOS & Android, Xamarin, and React native apps.

# Serverless computing
Azure Functions which can execute code in almost any modern language.
Azure Logic Apps which are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code.

-		Functions								Logic Apps
State		Normally stateless, but Durable Functions provide state			Stateful
Development	Code-first (imperative)							Designer-first (declarative)
Connectivity	About a dozen built-in binding types, write code for custom bindings	Large collection of connectors, Enterprise Integration Pack for B2B scenarios, build custom connectors
Actions		Each activity is an Azure function; write code for activity functions	Large collection of ready-made actions
Monitoring	Azure Application Insights						Azure portal, Log Analytics
Management	REST API, Visual Studio							Azure portal, REST API, PowerShell, Visual Studio
Execution context	Can run locally or in the cloud					Runs only in the cloud.

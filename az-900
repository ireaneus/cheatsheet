## Economies of scale - lower power, cooling, network costs

# Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
Migrating workloads
Test and development
Website hosting
Storage, backup, and recovery

# Platform as a service (PaaS)
Development framework
Analytics or business intelligence

# Software as a service (SaaS)

IaaS requires the most user management of all the cloud services. The user is responsible for managing the operating systems, data, and applications.
PaaS requires less user management. The cloud provider manages the operating systems, and the user is responsible for the applications and data they run and store.
SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the software.

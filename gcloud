# Sometimes Google Cloud services seem interchangeable
BigTable or DataStore
BigQuery or Cloud SQL
App Engine or Container Engine

# The exam asks you to make the best choice
The right choice is not always obvious
Look for keywords that give you a hint

Automate deployments using Google App Engine
Deploy hybrid cloud applications using Container Engine and Kubernetes
Build microservices using Google Cloud Functions

# Global resources
Global resources Global resources are accessible by any resource in any zone within the same project. When you create a global resource, you do not need to provide a scope specification. Global resources include: Firewall rules, Snapshots, networks, routes, etc. 
Global resource, but can rely on zonal resources (such as disks) ● Can only be used with managed instance groups ● Can include some or all configuration of a regular instance ● Instance and disk names will be generated from a configurable base name ● Ephemeral external IP addresses will be automatically assigned ● Single-instance properties limit creation to 1 instance/group Properties.disks[].source properties.disks[].initializeParams.diskName properties.networkInterfaces.accessConfigs.natIP

# Multi-regional resources
Cloud storage
Cloud Datastore
Cloud BigQuery

## IaaS ##
# Google Cloud Compute
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
On-demand pricing, Sustained use discount, Committed use discount, Preemptible VM
Disks: Standard, SSD, Local SSD - Pay for allocation
Snapshots: mv disks different zones and regions, resize.
Custom applications
Lift and Shift
N1-standard systems have CPU # in the name with 4x# for RAM

# GCP Networking
# VPC networking
You can create up to five networks per project
Auto mode VPC networks have a single, automatically created subnet in each region of the VPC network
For custom mode VPC networks, create a network, then create the subnets that you want within a region
7000 VMs per VPC network
Subnets are bound to regions
Each subnet defines a private IP address range
subnets are used for resource management
Networks can span multiple regions around the world
Shared VPC allows a network to be shared across multiple projects in a single organization
VPN tunnel can be used to connect 2 separate organizations
Machines in different networks can only communicate with public IPs
Machines without a public IP can only be accessed within a network

# Firewalls
Single firewall for entire VPC - implied deny all ingress, implied allow all egres
To access load-balanced servers, a firewall rule must be created for the appropriate networks
Best practice is to create firewall rules allowing traffic only from GCP Load Balancer networks

# Load Balancers
Can be created for HTTP, TCP, or UDP
Can span multiple regions or balance traffic to machines in multiple zones within a single region
Can send traffic to multiple machines managed by one or more instance groups forming a back-end service
Can also send requests to static content in Cloud Storage buckets
Allows HTTP(S) traffic to Compute Engine instances
Instances can be further secured by having no external IP addresses
Load balancing uses internal IP addresses
Leave a bastion host by which you can manage these instances

Network load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances ○ Supports non-HTTP(S) protocols (TCP/UDP) ○ Can be used for HTTPS traffic when you want to terminate connection on your instances (not at HTTPS load balancer) ● Supports autoscaling with managed instance groups

Global Forwarding Rules ● A global forwarding rule provides a single global IP address for an application ● The rule routes traffic by IP address, port, and protocol to an HTTP or HTTPS target proxy ● A global forwarding rule can only forward to a single port ○ Supporting HTTP and HTTPS requires two rules ● Global forwarding rules can only be used by an HTTP(S) load balancer

Cloud SSL proxy advantages (vs. network load balancing with termination of SSL connections on the instances) ○ Intelligent routing ○ Reduced CPI load on instances ○ Certificate management ○ Security patching

Target proxies are referenced by one or more global forwarding rules and route the incoming HTTP or HTTPS requests to a URL map. You can manage target proxies by using either the gcloud command-line tool or the REST API methods.

# Cloud DNS
Allows you to manage your domains right from GCP
Map domains and subdomains to load balancers, cloud storage buckets, or App Engine applications
100% SLA uptime

# Cloud CDN
Configured when setting up an HTTP(S) load balancer
CDN is cheaper for network egres traffic

# Cloud VPN
Cloud VPN allows secure access to VPC networks 
Can use a VPN to connect a GCP network to your local network using direct connect or interconnect see slide 54/55
Can use a VPN to connect different GCP networks

## PaaS ##
# Google Container Engine

# IAM
Use more restricted rights at the higher levels
Resources added at lower levels will inherit those restrictions
Privileges can be added at lower levels when necessary
Use service accounts and roles to secure machines and applications
Manage users in groups when possible
Audit your logs
Use roles to enforce the principle of least privilege
Use projects for separate duties
Cloud Platform supports SAML 2.0-based SSO, which provides seamless SSO against Cloud Platform Console, web- and command-line-based SSH, and OAuth authorization prompts, the user is prompted for their username but not their password.

# Service Accounts
Usually a member is a human
Service accounts are special accounts that identify machines or applications
Service accounts are created in the form of an email
Service accounts can be assigned one or more roles
A computer or application can run using a service account identity
That machine will only be allowed to perform actions allowed by its roles

# Roles
# Primitive Roles
Are project-wide roles
Project viewer can see everything in a project
Project editor can change everything in a project
Project owner has all rights of editor and can add members
The primitive roles do not provide fine-grained control over what members can do

# Predefined Roles
One role can’t remove permissions granted by another role
For example, if you make someone a Project Owner and a Storage Viewer, they have read-write access to storage
App Engine Admin, BigQuery User, or DataStore Viewer are examples of predefined roles
Many predefined roles exist
Principle of least privilege

# Deployment manager
Declarative
Reliable reproducable - deployment Manager
Cloud Launcher

All operations problems are treated as software problems though
Automate repetitive tasks
Fix problems with code

# Blue/Green Deployment
Allow new revisions to be deployed with less risk and no downtime
There are two copies of the production environment
Blue environment is taking requests
Green environment is idle
When deploying a new version:
Update new version to green environment leaving the blue environment in place
Test the green environment
When testing is complete, move the workload to the green environment
Green is now blue; can turn the old environment off
Blue-Green deployments also make rolling back to old versions easier
App Engine completely automates blue-green deployments
Multiple versions of App Engine apps can exist simultaneously
Can easily request any version by including the version in the URL
Testing can be done on new versions before migrating the load to them

# A/B Testing
A/B testing allows multiple versions of a program to run at the same time
Test the new version with a portion of the users 
Compare usage and errors of the two versions
Allows developers to get feedback and testing from real users prior to fully committing to a new version
In App Engine, use traffic-splitting 
for A/B testing

# Canary Release
A new version of a service is put into production alongside old versions
A small subset of select traffic is routed to the canary release
Canary releases help developers know how a new version will perform when put into production
Canary releases are easy to pull back if they fail their testing
Use a microservice architecture in App Engine
Each small service can be deployed separately from the other services in the application

# Study areas 
BigQuery BigTable Cloud Storage
Managed instance groups, Windows server scripts, pubsub, autoscaler, global forwarding rules
cloud ssl proxy, load balancers, connection draining, endpoints
Best practices and concepts

# Autoscaling
Graceful exit on autoscaling shrink event by running shutdown script to redirect incoming traffic at load balancer, and flush cache prior to exit.
The autoscaler will collect information based on the policy, compare it to your desired target utilization, and determine if it needs to perform scaling
Autoscaler controls managed instance group

# Instance grouping
regional managed instance groups improve your application availability by spreading your instances across three zones. 
Managed Instance group - instance group updater apply rolling updates - canary update rollback zero downtime
All unmanaged groups are used for is load balancing across dissimilar instances

# Connection draining
You can enable connection draining on backend services to ensure minimal interruption to your users when an instance is removed from an instance group, either manually or by an autoscaler. To enable connection draining, you set a timeout duration during which the backend service preserves existing sessions being handled by endpoints on an instance that will be removed. The backend service preserves these sessions until the timeout duration has elapsed, allowing user sessions to gracefully terminate, but preventing new connections to the instance. After the timeout duration is reached, the instance is terminated and all remaining connections are forcibly closed. You can set a timeout duration between 1 to 3600 seconds.

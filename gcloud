# Exam tested on:
# You are tested on your:
Knowledge of what Google’s cloud services are and their use cases
Understanding of how individual services work
Understanding of how Google’s services are intended to fit together

# Can you choose which services to use for various cases optimizing:
Availability
Scalability
Security
Price 

# Sometimes Google Cloud services seem interchangeable
BigTable or DataStore
BigQuery or Cloud SQL
App Engine or Container Engine

# The exam asks you to make the best choice
The right choice is not always obvious
Look for keywords that give you a hint

Automate deployments using Google App Engine
Deploy hybrid cloud applications using Container Engine and Kubernetes
Build microservices using Google Cloud Functions

# Multi-regional resources
Cloud storage
Cloud Datastore
Cloud BigQuery

## IaaS ##
# Google Cloud Compute
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
On-demand pricing, Sustained use discount, Committed use discount, Preemptible VM
Disks: Standard, SSD, Local SSD - Pay for allocation
Snapshots: mv disks different zones and regions, resize.
Custom applications
Lift and Shift

# GCP Networking
# VPC networking
Subnets are bound to regions
Each subnet defines a private IP address range
Networks can span multiple regions around the world
Shared VPC allows a network to be shared across multiple projects
Machines in different networks can only communicate with public IPs
Machines without a public IP can only be accessed within a network

# Load Balancers
Can be created for HTTP, TCP, or UDP
Can span multiple regions or balance traffic to machines in multiple zones within a single region
Can send traffic to multiple machines managed by one or more instance groups forming a back-end service
Can also send requests to static content in Cloud Storage buckets

# Cloud DNS
Allows you to manage your domains right from GCP
Map domains and subdomains to load balancers, cloud storage buckets, or App Engine applications

# Cloud CDN
Configured when setting up an HTTP(S) load balancer
CDN is cheaper for network egres traffic

# Cloud VPN
Cloud VPN allows secure access to VPC networks 
Can use a VPN to connect a GCP network to your local network
Can use a VPN to connect different GCP networks

## PaaS ##
# Google Container Engine
Used to deploy containerized applications
Applications deployed into a cluster of Compute Engine virtual machines
Application configuration is defined using Kubernetes open-source, orchestration framework
Kubernetes supports other clouds and on-premises deployments
GKE is more flexible than App Engine, but also less automated
Especially useful for hybrid deployments


# Google App Engine Standard
Each service is deployed independently
Services scale independently
Different languages can be used for different services
Can deploy multiple version simultaneously
Use traffic splitting to control which version(s) requests are sent to
Uses Google-specific containers for deploying services
Supports only Python, Java, PHP, and Go
Scales very quickly; containers can start in a couple hundred milliseconds
Will scale to zero instances when there is no traffic
free tier

# Google App Engine Flex
Uses Docker containers for deploying services
Supports any language that will run in a Docker container
Google provides preconfigured Docker containers for Python, Java, PHP, Go, Ruby, .NET, and NodeJS
Docker containers run in a Compute Engine virtual machine
Cannot scale to zero instances, so there is no free tier

# Google Cloud functions
Serverless environments for running Node.js functions
Just upload the code
Microservice architecture where each function performs one job
Can respond to Storage changes, Pub/Sub messages, or Web requests
Incredibly fast and scalable
Very inexpensive (first 2 million requests per month are free)

# Cloud Storage
Blob (binary large objects) storage is for storing any type of file
Relational storage is used for relational databases
NoSQL storage is for structured data 
Similar to relational, but simpler and often more scalable
Data warehousing is for data analysis and reporting
Buckets can be regional or multiregional
Data at rest stays in the region or regions specified
Can control access to buckets or objects inside buckets
  # Nearline
  Cost per GB is less than regional, but there is a cost for accessing data and a 1-month minimum charge
  Use for data that is accessed infrequently (photos might be an example)

  # Coldline
  Cost per GB is less than Nearline, but there is a higher cost for accessing data and a 3-month minimum charge
  Use for data archiving, backups, and disaster recovery

# Cloud SQL
Relational database storage
Supports MySQL and PostgreSQL (beta)
Simple setup and automated administration
Automated backups, maintenance, and replication
Built-in firewall prevents access from unauthorized computers
    # See slide 105 for docs

# Cloud Spanner
Massively scalable relational database service
Scales horizontally to hundreds or even thousands of servers
Strong consistency even with many servers
Uses atomic clocks to synchronize transactions around the globe
Designed for extremely high availability
Automatic replication
NoOps
    # See slide 107 for docs


# Cloud Datastore
NoSQL document database similar to MongoDB
Completely managed, NoOps
Supports ACID transactions across multiple entities
Flexible indexing allows for very fast and flexible data retrieval
Optimized for reading data quickly
1GB per month free tier
Redis - Memcache
    # See slide 108 for docs


# Cloud BigTable
Wide-column NoSQL datastore similar to Cassandra or HBase
Requires a cluster of machines be created
Cluster can be easily resized for scalability
Each row in a BigTable table must have a unique key
Only index available is the key
Very fast data retrieval as long as the key is searched
BigTable is optimized for extremely fast writes
Use BigTable when application accumulates huge amounts of data quickly
IoT applications, mobile apps, games, etc.


# Cloud BigQuery
Data warehousing and data analysis service
Extremely inexpensive storage
2 cents/GB/month for the first 3 months, then 1 cent/GB/month after
Analyze data with plain ANSI SQL 2011 queries 
Extremely fast: jobs split across many machines 
Easy to use: no indexes required, simple schemas
NoOps: no need to provision anything

# IAM
# Service Accounts
Usually a member is a human
Service accounts are special accounts that identify machines or applications
Service accounts are created in the form of an email
Service accounts can be assigned one or more roles
A computer or application can run using a service account identity
That machine will only be allowed to perform actions allowed by its roles

# Roles
# Primitive Roles
Are project-wide roles
Project viewer can see everything in a project
Project editor can change everything in a project
Project owner has all rights of editor and can add members
The primitive roles do not provide fine-grained control over what members can do

# Predefined Roles
One role can’t remove permissions granted by another role
For example, if you make someone a Project Owner and a Storage Viewer, they have read-write access to storage
App Engine Admin, BigQuery User, or DataStore Viewer are examples of predefined roles
Many predefined roles exist
Principle of least privilege


# GCP Dataflow
Apache Beam

# Cloud Pub/Sub
MQ Messaging
streaming data

# Cloud Dataproc
Hadoop/spark cluster
Hadoop - job written in Java
Spark - job written in Python
Hadoop and Spark clusters running in Google DataProc are examples


Reliable reproducable - deployment Manager
